# 🔢 Selection Sort Visualizer (Number-Based)

This is a visual representation of the **Selection Sort algorithm** using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**.  
Instead of using bar graphs, this project showcases sorting using **actual numbers**, providing a clean, intuitive, and educational experience.

# 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Bootstrap 5**

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Enter an array** in the input field (e.g. `5,3,1,4,2`)
2. Click **“🎲 Create Array”** to display the numbers
3. Click **“🚀 Start Sorting”** to begin selection sort
4. The UI will:
   - Highlight elements being compared
   - Mark the current minimum
   - Swap values and indicate sorted elements
   - Show step-by-step explanation below the numbers

## 🧠 Educational Value

Selection sort works by:
- Finding the minimum element from the unsorted part
- Swapping it with the beginning element
- Repeating this for each position until the array is sorted

This project demonstrates this visually with color-coded numbers and live narration of logic.
